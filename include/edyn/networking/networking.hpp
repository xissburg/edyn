 * decay per unit of time. To maintain a similar rate in that case, the

 * match the current state of the simulation, which means entities will
 * suddenly snap to a new position. To avoid this undesired visual disturbance,
 * the difference between the new and the old state is calculated and is decayed
 * over time. This difference can be added to the current transform to smooth
 * out these discontinuity effects. The `present_position` and
